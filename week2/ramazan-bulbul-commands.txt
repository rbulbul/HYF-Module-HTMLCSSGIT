1- git log -- <filename>

We can see commit's log that affect the specific file when we commited it. 
if we deleted with a commit with "git -rm <filename>" command in git history, we can save and return that commit. 


to do that,with this command you'll see hash number in the beginning of that log record. 
when you see where you added, take the 5 carachter so that we will do something with that commit, then;

2- git checkout (5 chrachter of Hash Number) -- <filename>

with this command, when you check git status, you would prabably see you saved that history and return that commit, 
and there will be both on staging and your working area.
